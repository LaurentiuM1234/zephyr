description: NXP Synchronous Audio Interface (SAI) node

compatible: "nxp,dai-sai"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
  mclk-is-output:
    required: false
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Use this property to set the SAI MCLK as output or as input.
      By default, if this property is not specified, MCLK will be
      set as input. Setting the MCLK as output for SAIs which don't
      support MCLK configuration will result in a BUILD_ASSERT()
      failure.
  rx-fifo-watermark:
    required: false
    type: int
    description: |
      Use this property to specify the watermark value for the TX
      FIFO. This value needs to be in FIFO words (NOT BYTES). This
      value needs to be in the following interval: (0, DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH],
      otherwise a BUILD_ASSERT() failure will be raised.
  tx-fifo-watermark:
    required: false
    type: int

      Use this property to specify the watermark value for the RX
      FIFO. This value needs to be in FIFO words (NOT BYTES). This
      value needs to be in the following interval: (0, DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH],
      otherwise a BUILD_ASSERT() failure will be raised.
  interrupts:
    required: true
  fifo-depth:
    required: false
    type: int
    description: |
      Use this property to set the FIFO depth that will be reported
      to other applications calling dai_get_properties(). This value
      should be in the following interval: (0, DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH],
      otherwise a BUILD_ASSERT() failure will be raised.
      By DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH we mean the actual (hardware) value of
      the FIFO depth. This is needed because some applications (e.g: SOF)
      use this value to compute the DMA burst size, in which case
      DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH cannot be used. Generally, reporting a false
      FIFO depth should be avoided. Please note that the sanity check
      for tx/rx-fifo-watermark uses DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH instead of this
      value so use with caution. If unsure, it's better to simply not
      use this property, in which case the reported value will be
      DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH.
